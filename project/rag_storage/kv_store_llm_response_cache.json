In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Influenza\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\nCauses\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 271\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\nSymptoms\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\n(i)\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\nTreatment and Control\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\nz\ndrink plenty of fluids\nz\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\nz\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\n7. Dengue\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\nHow does Dengue spread?\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 272\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\nabout 10 days.\nIncubation period\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\ninfected person.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\n(i)\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\n5 days.\n(ii)\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\n(v)\nNausea or vomiting.\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\n(i)\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\n(ii)\nRashes on the skin.\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\n(v)\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\nPrevention\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\n(i)\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\nbreed there.\n(ii)\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 273\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\nrain water.\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\n(v)\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\nactive.\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\nTreatment for dengue\n```",

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, nexon technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment. Gold futures rose by 1.5%, reaching $2,080 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets. Crude oil prices continued their rally, climbing to $87.60 per barrel, supported by supply constraints and strong demand.\n\nFinancial experts are closely watching the Federal Reserve's next move, as speculation grows over potential rate hikes.

Influenza\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\nCauses\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 271\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\nSymptoms\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\n(i)\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\nTreatment and Control\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\nz\ndrink plenty of fluids\nz\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\nz\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\n7. Dengue\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\nHow does Dengue spread?\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 272\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\nabout 10 days.\nIncubation period\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\ninfected person.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\n(i)\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\n5 days.\n(ii)\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\n(v)\nNausea or vomiting.\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\n(i)\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\n(ii)\nRashes on the skin.\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\n(v)\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\nPrevention\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\n(i)\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\nbreed there.\n(ii)\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 273\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\nrain water.\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\n(v)\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\nactive.\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\nTreatment for dengue\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\n(i)\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\nparasite which causes malaria.\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\nshelter.\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\nto humans).\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\ncause any suffering to it.\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 268\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\nfrom a disease.\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease. It is also called immunisation.\nIncubation period : The period between entry of pathogen inside a healthy body\nand appearance of the symptoms of the disease.\nSymptoms : Specific morphological or physiological expressions which appear on\nthe deseased organism and help in the identification of the disease.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.1\n1.

These are caused by different causative agents (pathogens).\n29.3.1 Diseases caused by viruses\n1. Chicken pox\nPathogen : Chicken pox virus (voricella)\nMode of transmission : By contact or through scabs\nIncubation period : 12-20 days\nSymptoms\n(i)\nFever, headache and loss of appetite\n(ii)\nDark red-coloured rash on the back and chest which spreads on the whole body.\nLater, rashes change into vesicles.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 269\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) After few days these vesicles start drying up and scabs (crusts) are formed.\n(v)\nThese scabs start falling (infective stage)\nPrevention and cure\nThere is no vaccine against chicken pox as yet. But precautions must be taken as\nfollows:\n(i)\nThe patient should be kept in isolation.\n(ii)\nClothings and utensils, used by the patient should be sterilised.\n(iii) Fallen scabs should be collected and burnt.\nOne attack of chicken pox gives life long immunity to the person recovered from\nthis disease.\n2. Measles\nPathogen : Virus (Rubeola)\nMode of transmission : By air\nIncubation period : 3-5 days\nSymptoms\n(i)\nCommon cold\n(ii) Appearance of small white patches in mouth and throat.\n(iii) Appearance of rashes on the body.\nPrevention and cure\n(i)\nThe patient should be kept in isolation.\n(ii) Cleanliness should be maintained.\n(iii) Antibiotics check only the secondary infections which can easily recur.\n3. Poliomyelitis\nPathogen : Polio Virus\nMode of transmissions : Virus enters inside the body through food or water.\nIncubation period : 7-14 days\nSymptoms\n(i)\nThe virus multiplies in intestinal cells and then reaches the brain through blood.\n(ii) It damages brain and nerves and causes infantile paralysis.\n(iii) Stiffness of neck, fever, loss of head support.\nPrevention and Cure\nPolio vaccine drop (oral polio vaccine, OPV) are given to children at certain\nintervals.\nPulse polio programme is organised in our country to give polio vaccine to\nchildren.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 270\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n4.

In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\nDiseases\nCongenital diseases\nAcquired diseases\n(Present since birth)\n(Develop after birth)\nCommunicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases\n(Spread from infected person\n(do not spread from a diseased person\nto healthy person\nto a healthy person)\nDegenerative\nDeficiency\nAllergies\nCancer\nOther diseases\ndiseases\ndiseases\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\nvarious physical\nmalfunctioning\nlack of nutrients of the body to\ngrowth of cells/\nagents or any\nof vital body\nin diet)\ncertain foreign\ntissues)\nother reason)\norgan)\nsubstances)\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\nlifetime.\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\n(i)\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 266\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\nbreast cancer.\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\n(i)\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\nan infected person to a healthy person.\n(ii)\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\naffected person to a healthy person.\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\nnon-communicable diseases\nCommunicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases\n1. Caused by some biological agents or\npathogens, such as viruses, bacteria,\nprotozoans and helminths (worms).\n2. Spread from one person to another\nthrough contact, water, air, and food, etc.\n3. The concern of the diseases involves\nthe society as these are related to\ncommunity health.\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\nfollowing ways.\nDirect transmission\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\n(i)\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\ncontact.\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\nCaused due to some specific factor,\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\nDo not spread from one person to\nanother by contact.\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\nto the individual only.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 267\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\nthe rabid animals.\nIndirect transmission\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\n(i)\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\nparasite which causes malaria.\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles,\n```",

It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\n(i)\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\nparasite which causes malaria.\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,\nsyringes and surgical instruments.\n(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with\npathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it\nreaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.\n29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER\nPathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.\nParasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.\nHost : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes\nshelter.\nInfestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of\nbody of the host or on the clothings.\nVector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another\nperson to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it\nto humans).\nCarrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically\ntransmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).\nReservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not\ncause any suffering to it.\nEpidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge\nloss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.\nEndemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people\ne.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 268\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nPandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.\nInterferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked\nby a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.\nInoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering\nfrom a disease.\nVaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order\nto secure immunity against the corresponding disease.

In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\nDiseases\nCongenital diseases\nAcquired diseases\n(Present since birth)\n(Develop after birth)\nCommunicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases\n(Spread from infected person\n(do not spread from a diseased person\nto healthy person\nto a healthy person)\nDegenerative\nDeficiency\nAllergies\nCancer\nOther diseases\ndiseases\ndiseases\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\nvarious physical\nmalfunctioning\nlack of nutrients of the body to\ngrowth of cells/\nagents or any\nof vital body\nin diet)\ncertain foreign\ntissues)\nother reason)\norgan)\nsubstances)\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\nlifetime.\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\n(i)\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 266\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\nbreast cancer.\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\n(i)\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\nan infected person to a healthy person.\n(ii)\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\naffected person to a healthy person.\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\nnon-communicable diseases\nCommunicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases\n1. Caused by some biological agents or\npathogens, such as viruses, bacteria,\nprotozoans and helminths (worms).\n2. Spread from one person to another\nthrough contact, water, air, and food, etc.\n3. The concern of the diseases involves\nthe society as these are related to\ncommunity health.\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\nfollowing ways.\nDirect transmission\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\n(i)\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\ncontact.\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\nCaused due to some specific factor,\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\nDo not spread from one person to\nanother by contact.\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\nto the individual only.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 267\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\nthe rabid animals.\nIndirect transmission\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\n(i)\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\nparasite which causes malaria.\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles,\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

Osteoporosis\nOsteoporosis is an age dependent disorder with loss of the normal density of bone.\nThe bones become fragile and are easily fractured. Bones that are affected by\nosteoporosis can fracture with only a minor fall or injury. Elderly men and women\nare most susceptible because of hormonal changes which occur with advancing age.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 280\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nSymptoms\n(i)\nThe persons suffering from osteoporosis may not know about their condition\nfor a long time, because osteoporosis doesn’t cause clear cut symptoms and\none may not realise till a bone fracture.\n(ii)\nThe symptoms of osteoporosis are related to the location of the fracture.\n(iii) Fractures of the spine can cause severe ‘band like’ pain that radiates around\nfrom the back to the side of the body. Repeated spine fractures can cause\nchronic lower back pain, as well as curving of the spine, which gives the\nindividual a hunched-back appearance.\n(iv) Some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while\nwalking or stepping off. Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With\nosteoporosis, hip fractures can occur upon even minor accidents. Hip fractures\nmay take a very long time to heal because of poor bone quality.\nTreatment\n(i)\nPatients suffering from osteoporosis are generally treated with vitamin D and\ncalcium supplements. In addition they are advised bed rest so that the condition\ndoes not worsen.\n(ii)\nChanges to lifestyle and diet are also recommended. The patients are advised\nto take calcium either via dietary means or via supplements in\n```",

Repeated spine fractures can cause\nchronic lower back pain, as well as curving of the spine, which gives the\nindividual a hunched-back appearance.\n(iv) Some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while\nwalking or stepping off. Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With\nosteoporosis, hip fractures can occur upon even minor accidents. Hip fractures\nmay take a very long time to heal because of poor bone quality.\nTreatment\n(i)\nPatients suffering from osteoporosis are generally treated with vitamin D and\ncalcium supplements. In addition they are advised bed rest so that the condition\ndoes not worsen.\n(ii)\nChanges to lifestyle and diet are also recommended. The patients are advised\nto take calcium either via dietary means or via supplements in the form of\ntablets. Since body absorbs about 500 mg calcium at a given time, the calcium\nintake should be spread throughout the day.\n(iii) Exercise also helps to protect persons from the risk of getting osteoporosis.\nHowever, it is important to do exercises for osteoporosis under the guidance\nof a professional physiotherapist.\n4.

The word “immuno deficiency” signifies that the immune\nsystem becomes very weak. It is a disease of cell-mediated immune system of the\nbody.\nLymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system i.e. T-lymphocytes and\nB-lymphocytes. ‘Helper T’ lymphocytes play a great role in regulating the immune\nsystem. Damages to or destruction of ‘Helper’ lymphocytes leads to the development\nof a cellular immune deficiency which makes the patient susceptible to wide variety\nof infections.\nFig. 29.2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nMode of transmission : AIDS may be transmitted through any of the following\nmeans :\n(i)\nSexual contact with the affected person. In India, the most common route of\nHIV transmission is through unprotected heterosexual sex.\n(ii) Using the same syringe that was used for affected person.\n(iii) Blood transfusion which contains human immuno deficiency virus.\n(iv) Organ transplantation of the affected person.\n(v) Artificial insemination.\n(vi) From mother to new born baby during the process of giving birth.\nIncubation period : The average period is 28 months though it may range between\n15 to 57 months\nSymptoms : The sufferer may show one or more of the following symptoms :\n(i)\nA type of lung disease develops (tuberculosis).\n(ii) A skin cancer may be observed.\n(iii) Nerves are affected.\n(iv) Brain is badly damaged with the loss of memory, ability to speak and to think.\nViral capsid\nRNA\nProtein\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 283\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(v) The number of platelets (thrombocytes) becomes less which may cause\nhaemorrhage.\n(vi) In severe cases the patient shows swollen lymph nodes, fever and loss of weight.\nA full blown (disease at its peak ) AIDS patient, may die within three years.\nPrevention and cure\nNo medicine or vaccine is known to be available against HIV infection. Therefore,\ncare has to be taken through following measures:\n(i)\nThere should not be any sexual contact with the person who has HIV infection\nor STI. Since STI causes some damage to the genital area and mucous layer,\nand thus facilitates the entry of HIV into the body.\n(ii) Use disposable syringe and needle.\n(iii) The blood to be transfused to the needy person, should be free from HIV germ.\n(iv) Prostitution and homosexuality should be avoided.\n(v) Condom should always be used during intercourse.\nControl\nAIDS can be detected by ELISA test.\nThere are three points which may be important to control STD.\n(i)\nPartner notification : Identification of potential infected contact, examination\nand treatment.\n(ii) Education of STD : This should be a part of general education.\n(iii) Screening for STD : Serological screening of groups, such as, blood donors,\nwomen before giving birth.\nFacts about HIV transmission\nz HIV is a weak virus and hard\n```",

Any kind of contact of sores with an infected person\nis also risky.\nIncubation period\nAbout 2-5 days after getting infection.\nSymptoms\n(i)\nInflammation of mucous membrane in the urinogenital tract.\n(ii)\nBurning sensation while passing out urine and urethral discharge.\n(iii) Rectal discomfort.\n(iv) Pain in the joints.\n(v)\nRashes on palms, Mild sore throat\n(vi) In females, it may cause sterility\nPrevention and cure\n(i)\nHaving sexual contact with only one person.\n(ii)\nAvoiding prostitution and homosexuality.\n(iii) Taking antibiotics, such as penicillin injection or appropriate medicines at the\nappropriate time as per Doctor’s advice.\nIn males, gonorrhoea primarily affects the urethra, anus, throat, joints and eyes. Most\nvictims of this disease are teenagers and young adults. One of the advanced\ncomplications of gonorrhoea is gonococcal septicemia (blood poisoning).\n29.6 DRUG ABUSE AND ITS PREVENTION\nWhat is a drug\nA drug is a chemical substance that changes the way our body and mind work. A\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\nWhat is drug abuse\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\nthat are often abused.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 286\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\nproblems.\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\ndetrimental to health:\nz\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\ndrowsiness.\nz\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\nSome Basic Facts\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just\n```",

Osteoporosis\nOsteoporosis is an age dependent disorder with loss of the normal density of bone.\nThe bones become fragile and are easily fractured. Bones that are affected by\nosteoporosis can fracture with only a minor fall or injury. Elderly men and women\nare most susceptible because of hormonal changes which occur with advancing age.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 280\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nSymptoms\n(i)\nThe persons suffering from osteoporosis may not know about their condition\nfor a long time, because osteoporosis doesn’t cause clear cut symptoms and\none may not realise till a bone fracture.\n(ii)\nThe symptoms of osteoporosis are related to the location of the fracture.\n(iii) Fractures of the spine can cause severe ‘band like’ pain that radiates around\nfrom the back to the side of the body. Repeated spine fractures can cause\nchronic lower back pain, as well as curving of the spine, which gives the\nindividual a hunched-back appearance.\n(iv) Some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while\nwalking or stepping off. Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With\nosteoporosis, hip fractures can occur upon even minor accidents. Hip fractures\nmay take a very long time to heal because of poor bone quality.\nTreatment\n(i)\nPatients suffering from osteoporosis are generally treated with vitamin D and\ncalcium supplements. In addition they are advised bed rest so that the condition\ndoes not worsen.\n(ii)\nChanges to lifestyle and diet are also recommended.

The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\ndrowsiness.\nz\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\nSome Basic Facts\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 287\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nSome Basic Facts\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\nSome Basic Facts\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\nInfection) without knowing about it?\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\nRTI.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\n1.

Repeated spine fractures can cause\nchronic lower back pain, as well as curving of the spine, which gives the\nindividual a hunched-back appearance.\n(iv) Some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while\nwalking or stepping off. Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With\nosteoporosis, hip fractures can occur upon even minor accidents. Hip fractures\nmay take a very long time to heal because of poor bone quality.\nTreatment\n(i)\nPatients suffering from osteoporosis are generally treated with vitamin D and\ncalcium supplements. In addition they are advised bed rest so that the condition\ndoes not worsen.\n(ii)\nChanges to lifestyle and diet are also recommended. The patients are advised\nto take calcium either via dietary means or via supplements in the form of\ntablets. Since body absorbs about 500 mg calcium at a given time, the calcium\nintake should be spread throughout the day.\n(iii) Exercise also helps to protect persons from the risk of getting osteoporosis.\nHowever, it is important to do exercises for osteoporosis under the guidance\nof a professional physiotherapist.\n4. Cancer\n1t is the uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells.\nCause\n(i)\nNo definite cause has been arrived at so far. However, it is found that body\nhas proto-oncogenes.

The word “immuno deficiency” signifies that the immune\nsystem becomes very weak. It is a disease of cell-mediated immune system of the\nbody.\nLymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system i.e. T-lymphocytes and\nB-lymphocytes. ‘Helper T’ lymphocytes play a great role in regulating the immune\nsystem. Damages to or destruction of ‘Helper’ lymphocytes leads to the development\nof a cellular immune deficiency which makes the patient susceptible to wide variety\nof infections.\nFig. 29.2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nMode of transmission : AIDS may be transmitted through any of the following\nmeans :\n(i)\nSexual contact with the affected person. In India, the most common route of\nHIV transmission is through unprotected heterosexual sex.\n(ii) Using the same syringe that was used for affected person.\n(iii) Blood transfusion which contains human immuno deficiency virus.\n(iv) Organ transplantation of the affected person.\n(v) Artificial insemination.\n(vi) From mother to new born baby during the process of giving birth.\nIncubation period : The average period is 28 months though it may range between\n15 to 57 months\nSymptoms : The sufferer may show one or more of the following symptoms :\n(i)\nA type of lung disease develops (tuberculosis).\n(ii) A skin cancer may be observed.\n(iii) Nerves are affected.\n(iv) Brain is badly damaged with the loss of memory, ability to speak and to think.\nViral capsid\nRNA\nProtein\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 283\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(v) The number of platelets (thrombocytes) becomes less which may cause\nhaemorrhage.\n(vi) In severe cases the patient shows swollen lymph nodes, fever and loss of weight.\nA full blown (disease at its peak ) AIDS patient, may die within three years.\nPrevention and cure\nNo medicine or vaccine is known to be available against HIV infection. Therefore,\ncare has to be taken through following measures:\n(i)\nThere should not be any sexual contact with the person who has HIV infection\nor STI. Since STI causes some damage to the genital area and mucous layer,\nand thus facilitates the entry of HIV into the body.\n(ii) Use disposable syringe and needle.\n(iii) The blood to be transfused to the needy person, should be free from HIV germ.\n(iv) Prostitution and homosexuality should be avoided.\n(v) Condom should always be used during intercourse.\nControl\nAIDS can be detected by ELISA test.\nThere are three points which may be important to control STD.\n(i)\nPartner notification : Identification of potential infected contact, examination\nand treatment.\n(ii) Education of STD : This should be a part of general education.\n(iii) Screening for STD : Serological screening of groups, such as, blood donors,\nwomen before giving birth.\nFacts about HIV transmission\nz HIV is a weak virus and hard\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

The common symptoms of syphilis include.\n(i)\nFever, and sores on the skin, in the throat and urinogenital areas especially\nvagina or penis, anus, rectum and mouth. Sores are firm, round and often\npainless.\n(ii)\nRashes on hands, feet and palms.\n(iii) White patches in the mouth.\n(iv) Acne-like warts in the groin area.\n(v)\nHair fall in patches from infected areas.\n(vi) The last three symptoms can be very serious. They often become internal and\naffect organs like brain, nerves, liver, eyes, blood vessels, bones and joints,\nwhich show up after about 10 years of getting the infection. It can lead to\nparalysis, blindness, dementia and sterility.\nPrevention and cure\n(i)\nHaving sexual intimacy with only one person.\n(ii)\nAvoiding prostitution and homosexuality.\n(iii) Practising abstinence, and use condoms.\n(iv) Taking appropriate medical treatment, and maintaing personal hygience.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 285\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n29.5.3 Gonorrhoea\nGonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease that often involves urethra, vagina or\npenis, cervix, anus, and throat, as its target sites.\nCausative organism\nA gonococcus bacterium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It grows and multiplies quickly\nin warm moist areas of the body, such as the cervix, rectum and mouth.\nModes of spread\nHaving multiple sex partners increases the risk of contracting it. Any kind of\nunprotected sex is always a risk. Any kind of contact of sores with an infected person\nis also risky.\nIncubation period\nAbout 2-5 days after getting infection.\nSymptoms\n(i)\nInflammation of mucous membrane in the urinogenital tract.\n(ii)\nBurning sensation while passing out urine and urethral discharge.\n(iii) Rectal discomfort.\n(iv) Pain in the joints.\n(v)\nRashes on palms, Mild sore throat\n(vi) In females, it may cause sterility\nPrevention and cure\n(i)\nHaving sexual contact with only one person.\n(ii)\nAvoiding prostitution and homosexuality.\n(iii) Taking antibiotics, such as penicillin injection or appropriate medicines at the\nappropriate time as per Doctor’s advice.\nIn males, gonorrhoea primarily affects the urethra, anus, throat, joints and eyes. Most\nvictims of this disease are teenagers and young adults. One of the advanced\ncomplications of gonorrhoea is gonococcal septicemia (blood poisoning).\n29.6 DRUG ABUSE AND ITS PREVENTION\nWhat is a drug\nA drug is a chemical substance that changes the way our body and mind work. A\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\nWhat is drug abuse\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\nthat are often abused.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 286\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\nproblems.\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\ndetrimental to health:\nz\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\ndrowsiness.\nz\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\nhow they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\nSome Basic Facts\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just\n```\n[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"---Task---\\nExtract entities and relationships from the input text to be processed.\\n\\n---Instructions---\\n1.  **Strict Adherence to Format:** Strictly adhere to all format requirements for entity and relationship lists, including output order, field delimiters, and proper noun handling, as specified in the system prompt.\\n2.  **Output Content Only:** Output *only* the extracted list of entities and relationships.

They will do anything for the dose,\nincluding committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.\nSome Basic Facts\nTeenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it\nfeels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 287\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nSome Basic Facts\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\nSome Basic Facts\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\nInfection) without knowing about it?\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\nRTI.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\n1.

If the entity name is case-insensitive, capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case). Ensure **consistent naming** across the entire extraction process.\n        *   `entity_type`: Categorize the entity using one of the following types: `Person,Creature,Organization,Location,Event,Concept,Method,Content,Data,Artifact,NaturalObject`. If none of the provided entity types apply, do not add new entity type and classify it as `Other`.\n        *   `entity_description`: Provide a concise yet comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities, based *solely* on the information present in the input text.\n    *   **Output Format - Entities:** Output a total of 4 fields for each entity, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line.

Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `target_entity`: The name of the target entity. Ensure **consistent naming** with entity extraction. Capitalize the first letter of each significant word (title case) if the name is case-insensitive.\n        *   `relationship_keywords`: One or more high-level keywords summarizing the overarching nature, concepts, or themes of the relationship. Multiple keywords within this field must be separated by a comma `,`. **DO NOT use `<|#|>` for separating multiple keywords within this field.**\n        *   `relationship_description`: A concise explanation of the nature of the relationship between the source and target entities, providing a clear rationale for their connection.\n    *   **Output Format - Relationships:** Output a total of 5 fields for each relationship, delimited by `<|#|>`, on a single line. The first field *must* be the literal string `relation`.\n        *   Format: `relation<|#|>source_entity<|#|>target_entity<|#|>relationship_keywords<|#|>relationship_description`\n\n3.  **Delimiter Usage Protocol:**\n    *   The `<|#|>` is a complete, atomic marker and **must not be filled with content**. It serves strictly as a field separator.\n    *   **Incorrect Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|location|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n    *   **Correct Example:** `entity<|#|>Tokyo<|#|>location<|#|>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.`\n\n4.  **Relationship Direction & Duplication:**\n    *   Treat all relationships as **undirected** unless explicitly stated otherwise. Swapping the source and target entities for an undirected relationship does not constitute a new relationship.\n    *   Avoid outputting duplicate relationships.\n\n5.  **Output Order & Prioritization:**\n    *   Output all extracted entities first, followed by all extracted relationships.\n    *   Within the list of relationships, prioritize and output those relationships that are **most significant** to the core meaning of the input text first.\n\n6.  **Context & Objectivity:**\n    *   Ensure all entity names and descriptions are written in the **third person**.\n    *   Explicitly name the subject or object; **avoid using pronouns** such as `this article`, `this paper`, `our company`, `I`, `you`, and `he/she`.\n\n7.  **Language & Proper Nouns:**\n    *   The entire output (entity names, keywords, and descriptions) must be written in `English`.\n    *   Proper nouns (e.g., personal names, place names, organization names) should be retained in their original language if a proper, widely accepted translation is not available or would cause ambiguity.\n\n8.  **Completion Signal:** Output the literal string `<|COMPLETE|>` only after all entities and relationships, following all criteria, have been completely extracted and outputted.\n\n---Examples---\n<Input Text>\n```\nwhile Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.

    "return": "Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, primarily transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The disease is marked by a range of symptoms, including fever, chills, anemia, and headaches. Various species of the Plasmodium parasite are responsible for different forms of malaria, each leading to severe health complications if left untreated.\n\nThe transmission of malaria occurs when an infected mosquito bites a human, introducing the parasites into the bloodstream. This mosquito-borne infection is classified as a communicable disease due to its transmission dynamics and public health implications. The symptoms can manifest in cycles, often featuring intense episodes of fever and chills, which can severely impact an individual's health and quality of life. \n\nMalaria remains a significant health challenge, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where conditions are conducive to mosquito breeding. Effective management and prevention strategies are essential to reduce the incidence of malaria and mitigate its impact on affected populations.",
