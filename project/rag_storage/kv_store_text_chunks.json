In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,\nphysiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional\ndeficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.\n29.1.1 Types of Diseases\nThe diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).\nTable 29.1 Classification of human diseases\nDiseases\nCongenital diseases\nAcquired diseases\n(Present since birth)\n(Develop after birth)\nCommunicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases\n(Spread from infected person\n(do not spread from a diseased person\nto healthy person\nto a healthy person)\nDegenerative\nDeficiency\nAllergies\nCancer\nOther diseases\ndiseases\ndiseases\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\n(caused due to\nhypersensitivity uncontrolled\nvarious physical\nmalfunctioning\nlack of nutrients of the body to\ngrowth of cells/\nagents or any\nof vital body\nin diet)\ncertain foreign\ntissues)\nother reason)\norgan)\nsubstances)\nA. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the\nheart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic\ndisorder or malfunctioning of an organ.\nB. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s\nlifetime.\nAcquired diseases may generally be classified into :\n(i)\nInfectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased\nhealthy person person to e.g. measles.\n(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital\norgans of the body e.g. heart failure.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 266\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as\nthat of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin\nB). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.\n(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.\nbreast cancer.\nAcquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).\n(i)\nCommunicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from\nan infected person to a healthy person.\n(ii)\nNon-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an\naffected person to a healthy person.\nTable 29.2 Differences between communicable and\nnon-communicable diseases\nCommunicable diseases\nNon-communicable diseases\n1. Caused by some biological agents or\npathogens, such as viruses, bacteria,\nprotozoans and helminths (worms).\n2. Spread from one person to another\nthrough contact, water, air, and food, etc.\n3. The concern of the diseases involves\nthe society as these are related to\ncommunity health.\n29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases\nCommunicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the\nfollowing ways.\nDirect transmission\nThe pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate\nagent. It can take place by various means such as,\n(i)\nDirect contact between the infected person and the healthy person :\nDiseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct\ncontact.\n(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by\ncoughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By\ninhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.\nDiseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and\nwhooping cough spread through droplet infection.\nCaused due to some specific factor,\nsuch as malfunctioning of some vital\norgan, and deficiency of nutrients.\nDo not spread from one person to\nanother by contact.\nThe concern of the disease is restricted\nto the individual only.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 267\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.\n(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by\nthe bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of\nthe rabid animals.\nIndirect transmission\nThe pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate\nagents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :\n(i)\nBy vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:\nHouseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth\nparts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and\ncontaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,\nhe gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial\nparasite which causes malaria.\n(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic\ntyphus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.\n(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use\nof contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles,",

Influenza\nInfluenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the\nrespiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.\nCauses\nInfluenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various\neffects depending on the strain of the virus.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 271\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nThere are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new\nvariations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the\nimmune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is\nconferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A\nperson infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the\nvirus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,\nand influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.\nSymptoms\nTypical symptoms of influenza include:\n(i)\nfever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).\n(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running\nnose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.\nAlthough nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza\ninfection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.\nMost people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people\ndevelop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.\nTreatment and Control\n(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual\ninfluenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those\nwho are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs\nor kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.\n(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should\nz\ndrink plenty of fluids\nz\ntake symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the\nage of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.\nz\nConsult doctor immediately for treatment.\n7. Dengue\nDengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)\nDengue hemorrhagic fever.\nDengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,\npain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.\nDengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced\nstage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other\nsymptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by\nsigns of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.\nHow does Dengue spread?\nDengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The\ntransmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and\nsubsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 272\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nvirus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first\nsymptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.\nAedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during\nday time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays\nher eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and\naround homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in\nabout 10 days.\nIncubation period\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of\nsymptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue\nviruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the\ninfected person.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Dengue fever\n(i)\nSudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-\n5 days.\n(ii)\nSevere headache mostly in the forehead.\n(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.\n(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.\n(v)\nNausea or vomiting.\nSymptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever\nThese include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:\n(i)\nSevere and continuous pain in the abdomen.\n(ii)\nRashes on the skin.\n(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.\n(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.\n(v)\nBlack stools due to internal bleeding.\n(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).\n(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.\nPrevention\nFollowing steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:\n(i)\nAvoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not\nbreed there.\n(ii)\nPrevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 273\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store\nrain water.\n(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.\n(v)\nUse mosquito nets, also during daytime.\n(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most\nactive.\n(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.\n(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.\nTreatment for dengue",

It is a disease of cell-mediated immune system of the\nbody.\nLymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system i.e. T-lymphocytes and\nB-lymphocytes. ‘Helper T’ lymphocytes play a great role in regulating the immune\nsystem. Damages to or destruction of ‘Helper’ lymphocytes leads to the development\nof a cellular immune deficiency which makes the patient susceptible to wide variety\nof infections.\nFig. 29.2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\nMode of transmission : AIDS may be transmitted through any of the following\nmeans :\n(i)\nSexual contact with the affected person. In India, the most common route of\nHIV transmission is through unprotected heterosexual sex.\n(ii) Using the same syringe that was used for affected person.\n(iii) Blood transfusion which contains human immuno deficiency virus.\n(iv) Organ transplantation of the affected person.\n(v) Artificial insemination.\n(vi) From mother to new born baby during the process of giving birth.\nIncubation period : The average period is 28 months though it may range between\n15 to 57 months\nSymptoms : The sufferer may show one or more of the following symptoms :\n(i)\nA type of lung disease develops (tuberculosis).\n(ii) A skin cancer may be observed.\n(iii) Nerves are affected.\n(iv) Brain is badly damaged with the loss of memory, ability to speak and to think.\nViral capsid\nRNA\nProtein\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 283\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n(v) The number of platelets (thrombocytes) becomes less which may cause\nhaemorrhage.\n(vi) In severe cases the patient shows swollen lymph nodes, fever and loss of weight.\nA full blown (disease at its peak ) AIDS patient, may die within three years.\nPrevention and cure\nNo medicine or vaccine is known to be available against HIV infection. Therefore,\ncare has to be taken through following measures:\n(i)\nThere should not be any sexual contact with the person who has HIV infection\nor STI. Since STI causes some damage to the genital area and mucous layer,\nand thus facilitates the entry of HIV into the body.\n(ii) Use disposable syringe and needle.\n(iii) The blood to be transfused to the needy person, should be free from HIV germ.\n(iv) Prostitution and homosexuality should be avoided.\n(v) Condom should always be used during intercourse.\nControl\nAIDS can be detected by ELISA test.\nThere are three points which may be important to control STD.\n(i)\nPartner notification : Identification of potential infected contact, examination\nand treatment.\n(ii) Education of STD : This should be a part of general education.\n(iii) Screening for STD : Serological screening of groups, such as, blood donors,\nwomen before giving birth.\nFacts about HIV transmission\nz HIV is a weak virus and hard",

It can lead to\nparalysis, blindness, dementia and sterility.\nPrevention and cure\n(i)\nHaving sexual intimacy with only one person.\n(ii)\nAvoiding prostitution and homosexuality.\n(iii) Practising abstinence, and use condoms.\n(iv) Taking appropriate medical treatment, and maintaing personal hygience.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 285\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\n29.5.3 Gonorrhoea\nGonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease that often involves urethra, vagina or\npenis, cervix, anus, and throat, as its target sites.\nCausative organism\nA gonococcus bacterium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It grows and multiplies quickly\nin warm moist areas of the body, such as the cervix, rectum and mouth.\nModes of spread\nHaving multiple sex partners increases the risk of contracting it. Any kind of\nunprotected sex is always a risk. Any kind of contact of sores with an infected person\nis also risky.\nIncubation period\nAbout 2-5 days after getting infection.\nSymptoms\n(i)\nInflammation of mucous membrane in the urinogenital tract.\n(ii)\nBurning sensation while passing out urine and urethral discharge.\n(iii) Rectal discomfort.\n(iv) Pain in the joints.\n(v)\nRashes on palms, Mild sore throat\n(vi) In females, it may cause sterility\nPrevention and cure\n(i)\nHaving sexual contact with only one person.\n(ii)\nAvoiding prostitution and homosexuality.\n(iii) Taking antibiotics, such as penicillin injection or appropriate medicines at the\nappropriate time as per Doctor’s advice.\nIn males, gonorrhoea primarily affects the urethra, anus, throat, joints and eyes. Most\nvictims of this disease are teenagers and young adults. One of the advanced\ncomplications of gonorrhoea is gonococcal septicemia (blood poisoning).\n29.6 DRUG ABUSE AND ITS PREVENTION\nWhat is a drug\nA drug is a chemical substance that changes the way our body and mind work. A\npharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter\nthe physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.\nWhat is drug abuse\nWhen drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical\nand mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.\nDrug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without\nmedical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,\nfrequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the\nindividual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines\nthat are often abused.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\nBIOLOGY\n 286\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nDrug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits\nare taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on\nthe quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its\nconsumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social\nproblems.\nWhat are the effects of drug abuse?\nDrug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are\ndetrimental to health:\nz\nShort-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes\nafter the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant\ndrowsiness.\nz\nLong-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period\ncan cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in\nacademic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;\nincreased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in\nvehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and\nhow they will get their next drug dose.

What\nis the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?\nIdeally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.\nBut there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or\ndrinking as compared to drugs.\nSmoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not\nalways lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that\ncan cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and\nin the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug\ncan start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes\naddicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and\ndistressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict\npersist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit\nunless they get medical treatment and counselling.\nYou should not boast about your strong will power and assume that\nyou can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS\nKEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to\npressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your\nresolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.\n\nSome Common Human Diseases\n 287\nBIOLOGY\nNotes\nMODULE - 4\nEnvironment and\nHealth\nSome Basic Facts\nWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?\nRTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of\nboth sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and\nprotozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur\ndue to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive\ntract and poor personal hygiene.\nSome Basic Facts\nIs it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract\nInfection) without knowing about it?\nSymptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware\nthat their sexual organs have been infected.\nHowever, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This\nmeans that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the\ninfection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have\nRTI.\nINTEXT QUESTIONS 29.7\n1.
