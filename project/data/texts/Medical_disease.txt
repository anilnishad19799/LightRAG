29.1 DISEASES
29.1 What is a disease?
Any malfunctioning process which interferes with the normal functioning of the body
is called a disease. In other words, disease may be defined as a disorder in the physical,
physiological, psychological or social state of a person caused due to nutritional
deficiency, physiological disorder, genetic disorder, pathogen or any other reason.
29.1.1 Types of Diseases
The diseases may be classified into two broad categories (Table 29.1).

A. Congenital disease : The disease which is present from birth (e.g. hole in the
heart in infants). They are caused by some genetic abnormality or metabolic
disorder or malfunctioning of an organ.
B. Acquired disease : The disease which may occur after birth during one’s
lifetime.
Acquired diseases may generally be classified into :
(i)
Infectious diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from diseased
healthy person person to e.g. measles.
(ii) Degenerative diseases : The diseases caused by the malfunction of some vital
organs of the body e.g. heart failure.

Health
(iii) Deficiency diseases : These are caused due to nutritional deficiency such as
that of minerals or vitamins in the diet e.g. anaemia (Fe), Beri- beri (vitamin
B). You have read about such diseases in an earlier lesson 27.
(iv) Cancer : This is an abnormal, uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells. e.g.
breast cancer.
Acquired diseases are studied under two categories (Table 29.2).
(i)
Communicable diseases : The diseases which can be transmitted from
an infected person to a healthy person.
(ii)
Non-communicable diseases : These diseases do not spread from an
affected person to a healthy person.
Table 29.2 Differences between communicable and
non-communicable diseases
Communicable diseases
Non-communicable diseases
1. Caused by some biological agents or
pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria,
protozoans and helminths (worms).
2. Spread from one person to another
through contact, water, air, and food, etc.
3. The concern of the diseases involves
the society as these are related to
community health.
29.1.2 Modes of Spread of Communicable  Diseases
Communicable diseases spread from the infected person to a healthy person in the
following ways.
Direct transmission
The pathogens of diseases infect a healthy person directly without an intermediate
agent. It can take place by various means such as,
(i)
Direct contact between the infected person and the healthy person :
Diseases like small pox, chicken pox, syphilis, gonorrhoea spread through direct
contact.
(ii) Droplet infection : The infected person throws out tiny droplets of mucus by
coughing, sneezing or spitting. These droplets may contain the pathogen. By
inhaling the air containing the droplets, a healthy person may get the infection.
Diseases like common cold, pneumonia, influenza, measles, tuberculosis and
whooping cough spread through droplet infection.
Caused due to some specific factor,
such as malfunctioning of some vital
organ, and deficiency of nutrients.
Do not spread from one person to
another by contact.
The concern of the disease is restricted
to the individual only.

Health
(iii) Contact with soil contaminated with disease-causing viruses and bacteria.
(iv) Animal bite : Viruses of rabies are introduced through the wound caused by
the bite of rabid animals, especially dogs. The virus is present in the saliva of
the rabid animals.
Indirect transmission
The pathogens of certain diseases reach the human body through some intermediate
agents. It can take place by various means, which are as follows :
(i)
By vectors such as houseflies, mosquitoes, and cockroaches. Examples:
Houseflies carry the causative organisms of cholera on their legs and mouth
parts from the faeces and sputum of infected persons to food and drinks and
contaminate them. When this contaminated food is taken by a healthy person,
he gets the infection. Similarly, mosquitoes carry virus of dengue and malarial
parasite which causes malaria.
(ii) Air-borne : The pathogens may reach humans with air and dust. The epidemic
typhus spreads by inhalation of dried faeces of infected fly.
(iii) Object borne (Fonite borne) : Many diseases are transmitted through the use
of contaminated articles, such as clothes, utensils, toys, door handles, taps,
syringes and surgical instruments.
(iv) Water borne : If potable water (drinking water) is contaminated with
pathogens of diseases such as cholera, diarhhoea, hepatitis or jaundice, it
reaches a healthy person upon consuming such water.
29.2 SOME IMPORTANT TERMS TO REMEMBER
Pathogen : A living organism which causes a disease.
Parasite : An organism which gets food and shelter from host.
Host : The living body on or inside which the disease-producing organism takes
shelter.
Infestation : Presence of a large number of parasitic organisms on the surface of
body of the host or on the clothings.
Vector : It is an organism which harbours a pathogen and may pass it on to another
person to cause a disease (Mosquitoes harbour malarial parasite and transmits it
to humans).
Carrier : It is an organism which itself does not harbour the pathogen but physically
transmits it to another person (Housefly is the carrier of cholera germs).
Reservoir : An organism which harbours pathogens in large numbers that do not
cause any suffering to it.
Epidemic : Spreading of a disease among a large number of people causing a huge
loss of life in the same place for some time e.g. plague.
Endemic : A disease which is regularly found among a particular group of people
e.g. goitre, restricted to a certain locality or a country.

Pandemic : A disease which is found all over the world e.g. AIDS.
Interferon : Type of proteins produced by infected cells of the body when attacked
by a virus, which act to prevent the further development of the same virus.
Inoculation : Introduction of antigenic material inside the body to prevent suffering
from a disease.
Vaccination : Injection of a weak strain of a specific bacterium (Vaccine) in order
to secure immunity against the corresponding disease. It is also called immunisation.
Incubation period : The period between entry of pathogen inside a healthy body
and appearance of the symptoms of the disease.
Symptoms : Specific morphological or physiological expressions which appear on
the deseased organism and help in the identification of the disease.

29.3 COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (INFECTIOUS DISEASES)
The diseases which spread from one diseased person to another through contaminated
food, water or contact or through insecticides, and animals are called the
communicable diseases. These are caused by different causative agents (pathogens).
29.3.1 Diseases caused by viruses
1. Chicken pox
Pathogen : Chicken pox virus (voricella)
Mode of transmission : By contact or through scabs
Incubation period : 12-20 days

6. Influenza
Influenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ is an illness caused by viruses that infect the
respiratory tract. Compared to common cold, influenza is a more severe illness.
Causes
Influenza is caused by a virus which attacks our body’s cells, resulting in various
effects depending on the strain of the virus.

Some Common Human Diseases
 271
BIOLOGY
Notes
MODULE - 4
Environment and
Health
There are many strains of influenza virus. The virus mutates all the time and new
variations (strains) arise. This constant changing enables the virus to evade the
immune system of its host. Unfortunately immunity against one strain (which is
conferred by exposure or immunisation) does not protect against other strains. A
person infected with influenza virus develops antibodies against that virus; as the
virus changes, the antibodies against the virus do not recognize the changed virus,
and influenza can recur, caused by the changed or mutated virus.
Symptoms
Typical symptoms of influenza include:
(i)
fever (Usually 100° F to 103° F in adults and often even higher in children).
(ii) respiratory tract infection symptoms such as, cough, sore throat, running
nose, headache, pain in the muscles, and extreme fatigue.
Although nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea can sometimes accompany Influenza
infection, especially in children, gastrointestinal symptoms are rarely prominent.
Most people who get flu, recover completely in 1 to 2 weeks, but some people
develop serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia.
Treatment and Control
(i) Much of the illness and death caused by influenza can be prevented by annual
influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccine is specifically recommended for those
who are at high risk for complications with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs
or kidneys, diabetes, or severe forms of anaemia.
(ii) The persons suffering from influenza should
z
drink plenty of fluids
z
take symptom relief with paracetamol, aspirin (not in children under the
age of 16) or ibuprofen as recommended by the doctor.
z
Consult doctor immediately for treatment.
7. Dengue
Dengue is an acute fever caused by virus. It is of two types: (i) Dengue fever, (ii)
Dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dengue fever is characterized by an onset of sudden high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes and in the muscles and joints.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute infectious viral disease. It is an advanced
stage of dengue fever. It is characterized by fever during the initial phase and other
symptoms like headache, pain in the eye, joint pain and muscle pain, followed by
signs of bleeding, red tiny spots on the skin, and bleeding from nose and gums.
How does Dengue spread?
Dengue spreads through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito. The
transmission of the disease occurs when a mosquito bites an infected person and
subsequently bites a healthy person. In doing so, it transmits blood containing the

Some Common Human Diseases
BIOLOGY
 272
Notes
MODULE - 4
Environment and
Health
virus to the healthy person and the person becomes infected with dengue. The first
symptoms of the disease occur about 5 to 7 days after the infected bite.
Aedes mosquito rests indoors, in closets and other dark places, and is active during
day time. Outside, it rests where it is cool and shaded. The female mosquito lays
her eggs in stagnant water containers such as coolers, tyres, empty buckets, in and
around homes, and other areas in towns or villages. These eggs become adults in
about 10 days.
Incubation period
The time between the bite of a mosquito carrying dengue virus and the start of
symptoms averages 4 to 6 days, with a range of 3 to 14 days.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made through blood tests by scanning for antibodies against dengue
viruses. In addition the blood platelet counts also get drastically reduced in the
infected person.
Symptoms
Symptoms of Dengue fever
(i)
Sudden onset of high fever, generally 104-105 °F (40 °C), which may last 4-
5 days.
(ii)
Severe headache mostly in the forehead.
(iii) pain in the joints and muscles, body aches.
(iv) Pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movement.
(v)
Nausea or vomiting.
Symptoms of Dengue hemorrhagic fever
These include symptoms similar to dengue fever, plus other symptoms such as:
(i)
Severe and continuous pain in the abdomen.
(ii)
Rashes on the skin.
(iii) Bleeding from the nose, mouth, or in the internal organs.
(iv) Frequent vomiting with or without blood.
(v)
Black stools due to internal bleeding.
(vi) Excessive thirst (dry mouth).
(vii) Pale, cold skin, weakness.
Prevention
Following steps can be taken to prevent spread of dengue fever:
(i)
Avoid water stagnation for more than 72 hours so that the mosquitoes do not
breed there.
(ii)
Prevent mosquito breeding in stored water bodies, like ponds, and wells.

(iii) Destroy discarded objects like old tyres and bottles, as they collect and store
rain water.
(iv) Use mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes to curtail exposure.
(v)
Use mosquito nets, also during daytime.
(vi) Avoid outdoor activities during dawn or dusk when these mosquitoes are most
active.
(vii) Patients suffering from dengue fever must be isolated for at least 5 days.
(viii) Report to the nearest health centre for any suspected case of Dengue fever.
Treatment for dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Persons with dengue fever should
rest and drink plenty of fluids. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is treated by replacing
lost fluids. Some patients need blood transfusions to control bleeding.

3. Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is an age dependent disorder with loss of the normal density of bone.
The bones become fragile and are easily fractured. Bones that are affected by
osteoporosis can fracture with only a minor fall or injury. Elderly men and women
are most susceptible because of hormonal changes which occur with advancing age.

Some Common Human Diseases
BIOLOGY
 280
Notes
MODULE - 4
Environment and
Health
Symptoms
(i)
The persons suffering from osteoporosis may not know about their condition
for a long time, because osteoporosis doesn’t cause clear cut symptoms and
one may not realise till a bone fracture.
(ii)
The symptoms of osteoporosis are related to the location of the fracture.
(iii) Fractures of the spine can cause severe ‘band like’ pain that radiates around
from the back to the side of the body. Repeated spine fractures can cause
chronic lower back pain, as well as curving of the spine, which gives the
individual a hunched-back appearance.
(iv) Some patients with osteoporosis develop stress fractures of the feet while
walking or stepping off. Hip fractures typically occur as a result of a fall. With
osteoporosis, hip fractures can occur upon even minor accidents. Hip fractures
may take a very long time to heal because of poor bone quality.
Treatment
(i)
Patients suffering from osteoporosis are generally treated with vitamin D and
calcium supplements. In addition they are advised bed rest so that the condition
does not worsen.
(ii)
Changes to lifestyle and diet are also recommended. The patients are advised
to take calcium either via dietary means or via supplements in the form of
tablets. Since body absorbs about 500 mg calcium at a given time, the calcium
intake should be spread throughout the day.
(iii) Exercise also helps to protect persons from the risk of getting osteoporosis.
However, it is important to do exercises for osteoporosis under the guidance
of a professional physiotherapist.
4. Cancer
1t is the uncontrolled and unwanted growth of cells.
Cause
(i)
No definite cause has been arrived at so far. However, it is found that body
has proto-oncogenes. These are activated by some substances or stimulus,
which convert these into active cancer-causing oncogenes.
(ii)
Heavy smoking and alcoholism.
(iii) Chewing of tobacco.
(iv) Consistent irritation of skin or repeated injury at the same point.
Cancer is a kind of tumorous growth. Tumours can be classified into two categories :
(a) Benign tumour
It remains confined to the place of origin and does not spread to other body parts.
It is relatively harmless.

29.5 SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
The diseases that are transmitted through sexual contact are known as sexually
transmitted diseases. Sexually transmitted diseases are those diseases that are
transmitted via the mucous membrane and secretions of the sexual organ, throat and
the rectum. Syphilis, gonorrhoea, and AIDS are some sexually transmitted diseases.

29.5.1 AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome)
It is a pandemic disease. The word “immuno deficiency” signifies that the immune
system becomes very weak. It is a disease of cell-mediated immune system of the
body.
Lymphocytes are the main cells of the immune system i.e. T-lymphocytes and
B-lymphocytes. ‘Helper T’ lymphocytes play a great role in regulating the immune
system. Damages to or destruction of ‘Helper’ lymphocytes leads to the development
of a cellular immune deficiency which makes the patient susceptible to wide variety
of infections.
Fig. 29.2 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
Mode of transmission : AIDS may be transmitted through any of the following
means :
(i)
Sexual contact with the affected person. In India, the most common route of
HIV transmission is through unprotected heterosexual sex.
(ii) Using the same syringe that was used for affected person.
(iii) Blood transfusion which contains human immuno deficiency virus.
(iv) Organ transplantation of the affected person.
(v) Artificial insemination.
(vi) From mother to new born baby during the process of giving birth.
Incubation period : The average period is 28 months though it may range between
15 to 57 months
Symptoms : The sufferer may show one or more of the following symptoms :
(i)
A type of lung disease develops (tuberculosis).
(ii) A skin cancer may be observed.
(iii) Nerves are affected.
(iv) Brain is badly damaged with the loss of memory, ability to speak and to think.

(v) The number of platelets (thrombocytes) becomes less which may cause
haemorrhage.
(vi) In severe cases the patient shows swollen lymph nodes, fever and loss of weight.
A full blown (disease at its peak ) AIDS patient, may die within three years.
Prevention and cure
No medicine or vaccine is known to be available against HIV infection. Therefore,
care has to be taken through following measures:
(i)
There should not be any sexual contact with the person who has HIV infection
or STI. Since STI causes some damage to the genital area and mucous layer,
and thus facilitates the entry of HIV into the body.
(ii) Use disposable syringe and needle.
(iii) The blood to be transfused to the needy person, should be free from HIV germ.
(iv) Prostitution and homosexuality should be avoided.
(v) Condom should always be used during intercourse.
Control
AIDS can be detected by ELISA test.
There are three points which may be important to control STD.
(i)
Partner notification : Identification of potential infected contact, examination
and treatment.
(ii) Education of STD : This should be a part of general education.
(iii) Screening for STD : Serological screening of groups, such as, blood donors,
women before giving birth.
Facts about HIV transmission
z HIV is a weak virus and hard to get infected with. It cannot be transmitted
through air or water outside the human body.
z A person cannot get AIDS by hugging or sneezing of an infected person, insect
bites (including mosquito), sharing the same comb, plates, glass, handkerchiefs,
knives or cutlery.
z A person cannot get AIDS by using public toilets, swimming pools, showers
and telephones.
z HIV cannot be transmitted by being near to someone, touching someone or
working with someone who is suffering from AIDS.

29.5.2 Syphilis
Causative organism
Treponema pallidum (a long corkscrew bacteria)
Mode of spread
Sexual contact with the infected person
Incubation period
Symptoms of the disease occur in about 10-90 days after contraction, but generally
noticed in 3-4 weeks after getting infected with the bacteria.
Symptoms
Symptoms of syphilis occur in stages. The common symptoms of syphilis include.
(i)
Fever, and sores on the skin, in the throat and urinogenital areas especially
vagina or penis, anus, rectum and mouth. Sores are firm, round and often
painless.
(ii)
Rashes on hands, feet and palms.
(iii) White patches in the mouth.
(iv) Acne-like warts in the groin area.
(v)
Hair fall in patches from infected areas.
(vi) The last three symptoms can be very serious. They often become internal and
affect organs like brain, nerves, liver, eyes, blood vessels, bones and joints,
which show up after about 10 years of getting the infection. It can lead to
paralysis, blindness, dementia and sterility.
Prevention and cure
(i)
Having sexual intimacy with only one person.
(ii)
Avoiding prostitution and homosexuality.
(iii) Practising abstinence, and use condoms.
(iv) Taking appropriate medical treatment, and maintaing personal hygience.

29.5.3 Gonorrhoea
Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease that often involves urethra, vagina or
penis, cervix, anus, and throat, as its target sites.
Causative organism
A gonococcus bacterium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It grows and multiplies quickly
in warm moist areas of the body, such as the cervix, rectum and mouth.
Modes of spread
Having multiple sex partners increases the risk of contracting it. Any kind of
unprotected sex is always a risk. Any kind of contact of sores with an infected person
is also risky.
Incubation period
About 2-5 days after getting infection.
Symptoms
(i)
Inflammation of mucous membrane in the urinogenital tract.
(ii)
Burning sensation while passing out urine and urethral discharge.
(iii) Rectal discomfort.
(iv) Pain in the joints.
(v)
Rashes on palms, Mild sore throat
(vi) In females, it may cause sterility
Prevention and cure
(i)
Having sexual contact with only one person.
(ii)
Avoiding prostitution and homosexuality.
(iii) Taking antibiotics, such as penicillin injection or appropriate medicines at the
appropriate time as per Doctor’s advice.
In males, gonorrhoea primarily affects the urethra, anus, throat, joints and eyes. Most
victims of this disease are teenagers and young adults. One of the advanced
complications of gonorrhoea is gonococcal septicemia (blood poisoning).
29.6 DRUG ABUSE AND ITS PREVENTION
What is a drug
A drug is a chemical substance that changes the way our body and mind work. A
pharmaceutical preparation or a naturally occurring substance used primarily to alter
the physical or mental functioning of an individual, is called a drug.
What is drug abuse
When drugs are taken for medical reasons to treat or cure disease both physical
and mental, they are called medications or therapeutic drugs.
Drug abuse occurs when drugs are taken without medical reasons and without
medical supervision, especially when they are taken in an amount, strength,
frequency, or manner that damages the physical and mental functioning of the
individual. Cough syrups, pain killers, and tranquillizers are some common medicines
that are often abused.

Some Common Human Diseases
BIOLOGY
 286
Notes
MODULE - 4
Environment and
Health
Drug abuse also occurs when certain chemicals that have no medical use or benefits
are taken, such as sniffing glue and solvents. The extent of drug abuse depends on
the quantity of the drug being taken, and the method and frequency of its
consumption. Drug abuse leads to many serious physical, emotional, and social
problems.
What are the effects of drug abuse?
Drug abuse leads to a number of short-term and long-term effects that are
detrimental to health:
z
Short-term effects : These are the effects that appear instantly or a few minutes
after the intake of drugs. The effects include a sense of well-being and a pleasant
drowsiness.
z
Long-term effects :  Constant and excessive use of drugs over a long period
can cause both physical and mental damage and illness. This includes failure in
academic studies, employment, and interpersonal relationship; financial ruin;
increased risk of contracting STIs; and increased risk of being involved in
vehicular accidents. Addicts stop thinking of everything in life except when and
how they will get their next drug dose. They will do anything for the dose,
including committing crimes such as theft and in certain case even murder.
Some Basic Facts
Teenagers sometimes try a smoke or drink just to see how it
feels, but they do not start using drugs on a regular basis. What
is the harm in trying drugs just to see how it feels?
Ideally, there is no need to try out a smoke or drink.
But there is a great difference between “ trying out” smoking  or
drinking as compared to drugs.
Smoking and drinking once only or very occasionally does not
always lead to addiction. But drugs are very powerful chemicals that
can cause profound alterations in the metabolism of the  body and
in the chemistry of the brain. Even a single dose of a powerful drug
can start the addiction process. When one’s mind and body becomes
addicted to drugs, stopping drugs produces very unpleasant and
distressing mental and physical symptoms. This makes the addict
persist with the usage of the drug. Addicts cannot give up their habit
unless they get medical treatment and counselling.
You should not boast about your strong will power and assume that
you can experiment with drugs without becoming addicted. ALWAYS
KEEP AWAY from drugs. Do not allow yourself to succumb to
pressure by friends and acquaintances. If you remain firm in your
resolve, you can prevent your life from being ruined.

Some Basic Facts
What are Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs)?
RTIs are infections of the upper and lower reproductive tracts of
both sexes. Agents of infection include bacteria, viruses, and
protozoa. Not all RTIs are sexually transmitted; some may occur
due to an imbalance of the bacteria normally found in the reproductive
tract and poor personal hygiene.
Some Basic Facts
Is it possible for a person to have an RTI (Reproductive  Tract
Infection) without knowing about it?
Symptoms of RTIs in men are visible, and hence they become aware
that their sexual organs have been infected.
However, RTIs in women sometimes can be asymptomatic. This
means that signs or symptoms are not experienced even though the
infection is active. Hence women often do not know that they have
RTI.
